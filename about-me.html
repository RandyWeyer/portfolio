        <div class="biography">
<p>In May of 2016, I watched a documentary going over the basic uses of algorithms and how they have changed dramatically in the last 10-20 years. This is how I learned about the classic computer science problem of the Travelling Salesman. For those of you that aren't familiar with it, it's deceptive simple to describe but there are current no known perfect solutions.</p>

<p>The problem is, given a set number of points (generally on a <em>2-dimensional plane</em>), what is the shortest path between all the points. Sometimes people see this as a combinatorial problem and try to optimize sorting and evaluating distances in each path. Others may see it as a geometric problem that requires proofs so that a computer could always give the optimal path based on coordinates or "weights" of each path.</p>

<p>I had a theory that worked on paper but I needed the precision, speed and adaptability of a computer program to attempt to prove that my theory worked. I started learning Visual Basic and etched out a rough version of that. After that I decided to learn Java and translated the basic algorithm into the Java language. Through this I independently recreated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees</a>.</p>

    <p>Lapel, a Ruby on Rails Web App</p>
  </div>
</div>
  <p>A small company for startups saw my prototype and hired me to make a webpage in Ruby on Rails for them. There is currently a live version up at <a href="https://lapel.herokuapp.com/">https://lapel.herokuapp.com/</a>, but some of the best features are not public or behind a paywall.</p>

  <p>Since then I have worked on my personal game development or doing game testing at Microsoft. I also voluteer as a Walkthrough Overseer at <a href="http://trueachievements.com">TrueAchievements</a>.  I then joined the bootcamp <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> to boost my knowledge and become a full-fledged developer.
